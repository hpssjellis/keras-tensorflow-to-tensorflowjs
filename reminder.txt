right click on rocksetta???.sh files and select run to see examples working

You can always run any of the python files the normal way by openning a terminal and entering

source ~/virtual-tf/bin/activate


then enter
python filename.py

reminder to type deactivate to stop running the virtual environment

A few extra reminders

type a few letters of a file and click the tab key to autocomplete
cd .. goes up a lvel
cd foldername goes into the folder

ls or dir list a folders files

the rocksetta bash files can also be run this way by typing
bash rocksetta??.sh




NOTE: The above manual method presently will have to be used for true TensorFlow examples as I have not made rocksetta files for those yet.

Note with the tensoerflow examples you may have to change the /tmp file path so that the examples work with tensorboard. I use this file path, since thenormal /tmp is invisible to the easy cloud9 directory structure (still works using the manual method)

/home/ubuntu/workspace/tmp5




P.S. always close your run windows as some of them may have processes still running that then stops new processes from running.
